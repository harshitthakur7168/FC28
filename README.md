Soil moisture sensor with buzzer

We all love nature. Living this fast paced and modern work we hardly get time to enjoy nature. But to get clean and pure air we usually have plants in our home which not only provide us fresh air but also make our house look asthetic. 
Here Im interfacng arduino with FC28 which is an moisture calculator sensor. This will let us know the exact moisture of soil and alert us when watering them is required even if we froget watering them. I have also attached buzzer with it so that we get alerted with sound.
Suggestions and improvements are welcomed.
